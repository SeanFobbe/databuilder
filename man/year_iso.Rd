\title{\subsection{year.iso: Transform Two-Digit Years to Four-Digit Years}{

This function transforms two-digit years (YY) to four-digit years compliant with ISO-8601 (YYYY). It is based on the assumption that two-digit years above a certain boundary year belong to the previous century and years at or below that boundary belong to the next century.
